.SH NAME
.B shellby\fR \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shellby\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes commands read from standard input.
.PP
.B Invocation
.PP
\fBShellby\fR can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.
.PP
If \fBshellby\fR is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell is opened.
When executing interactively, \fBshellby\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is ready to read a command.
.PP
.B Command Execution
.PP
After receiving a command, \fBshellby\fR tokenizes it into words using \fB" "\fR as a delimiter and takes the following actions:
.RS
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
.PP
If the command name contains no slashes and is not a builtin, \fBshellby\fR searches each element of the 
\fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.PP
If the command name contains slashes or either of the above searches is successful, the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.
.RE
.PP
.B Exit Status
.PP
.B Shellby\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.
.PP
If a command is not found, the return status is 127; if a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
.PP
All builtins return zero on success and two on incorrect usage.
.PP
.B Signals
.PP
While running in interactive mode, \fBshellby\fR ignores the keyboard input \fBCtrl+c\fR.
Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR) will exit the program.
.PP
.B Shellby Builtin Commands
.RS
.B cd
.RS
